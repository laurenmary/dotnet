Recently, in the [comments of a Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38553291), I learned about [BirdNET-Pi](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi) and [BirdWeather](https://app.birdweather.com/). As both a half-assed birder and a half-assed home server admin, I couldn't wait to try setting it up myself.

After a couple of days of research and shopping around, I purchased the following:
+ [Raspberry Pi 4B, 4 GB memory kit](https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4b-budget-kit/)
    + Includes a case, power supply, and heatsinks
+ [This cheapie USB sound card dongle](https://www.pishop.us/product/usb-audio-adapter-works-with-raspberry-pi/)
    + I wasn't sure if I would be using USB or 3.5 mm to connect my microphone - I ultimately chose the retailer I did because they sell this cheap sound card
+ A microSD card
